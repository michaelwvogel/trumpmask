 *  
 * This sketch uses code from the daphc and softVolume examples included in the WaveHC library for the Adafruit Arduino Waveshield, 
 * as well as the adavoice sketch for the Adafruit Microphone Amplifier Breakout.
 * 
 * This sketch detects microphone input to trigger WAV playback, and monitors input from 
 * an IR proximity sensor, manipulating WAV playback volume based on this analog input.
 * 
 * Hardware requirements:
 * - Arduino Uno, Duemilanove or Diecimila (not Mega or Leonardo compatible).
 * - Adafruit Wave Shield
 * - Speaker attached to Wave Shield output
 * - Battery for portable use
 * - Adafruit Microphone Breakout
 * - SD card
 * - QRD1114 IR emitter / Phototransistor
 * - Donald Trump halloween mask
 * - Baseball cap to hide components 
 * 
 * Software requirements:
 * - WaveHC library for Arduino
 * - WAV files on FAT-formatted SD card (included here)
 * 
 * May Trump's reign be short.
